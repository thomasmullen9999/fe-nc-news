# Northcoders News Front-End Website

This project was created as a consolidation of my learning during the front-end portion of my time on the Northcoders software development course. Its purpose is to create a news website which acts as a user interface for accessing the data provided by the API I created in my back-end project. 

When accessing the site, users can view different articles and comments, vote on articles and add their own comments to the site, similarly to real-world sites such as Facebook and Reddit. They can also sort articles by different criteria such as number of votes and date of creation, view all articles of a particular topic, and delete their own comments (if they are logged in). This project primarily uses React.js, with Bootstrap.

The hosted version of the website that this project creates can be found here:<br> https://thomas-mullen-nc-news.netlify.app/
